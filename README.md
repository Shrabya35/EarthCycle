# Earth Rotation Simulation with Three.js

This project is a simple 3D Earth simulation using Three.js. 

## Features
- **Textured Earth and Moon**: The Earth and Moon are rendered with detailed textures and normal maps.
- **Dynamic asteroids**: 200 asteroids are randomly placed in the 3D space.
- **Lighting**: A combination of point light and ambient light adds depth and shadows to the scene.
- **Camera Movement**: The camera smoothly rotates around the Earth as the user scrolls, providing a dynamic viewing experience.
- **Rotation Animations**: Both the Earth and the Moon rotate continuously, simulating their real-life motion.

## How To Use It
- Scroll through the site back and forth to create an infinite loop.
- Adjust the speed of scrolling to ensure smoothness.
